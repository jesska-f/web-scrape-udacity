# Web Scraping In Python to get Information about Courses on Udacity
I wanted to see which courses on Udacity formed part of the different Nanodegrees. I first got a list of all the courses (accessible on https://www.udacity.com/courses/all) and then visited the URL for each course to extract info about the Nanodegree it belonged to.

Dataquest has an awesome tutorial on how to do web scraping, which I recommend you go through if you are new to it. https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/

This makes use of BeautifulSoup to easily extract HTML elements from the content in a response of getting a web page.
